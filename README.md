# LastFmPlugin

This repo contains the code for the Last.Fm download plug-in which can be used with Helium 12.
The plug-in requires Visual Studio 2015 Update 2.

## Using the code

To be able to run this plug-in you will need to have Helium 12 (Neon) installed and its web service active.
Neon can be downloaded from: https://implodedsoftware.wordpress.com/

When you open the solution for the first time, be sure to restore NuGet packages.
After that you need to fill in your Amazon (AWS) key and secret in the LastFmConstants.cs class.
